# Force11 Software Citation Working Group

##Mission Statement (WIP)

The software citation working group is committee that will leverage the perspectives of a variety of existing initiatives working on software citation to  produce a consolidated set of citation principles in order to encourage broad adoption of a consistent policy for software citation across disciplines and venues.  The working group will review existing efforts and make a set of recommendations. These recommendations will be put up for endorsement by the organizations represented by this group and others that play an important role in the community.

The group will produce a set of principles, illustrated with working examples, and a plan for dissemination and distribution.  This group will not be producing detailed specifications for implementation although it may review and discuss possible technical solutions.

Co-chairs: Dan Katz & Arfon Smith
